# 🛒 Shopping Cart Application (Singleton Pattern)

## 📋 Overview

This is a simple, console-based Java application for managing a shopping cart.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the **Singleton Design Pattern** by ensuring that only one instance of the `ShoppingCart` exists throughout the program, regardless of how many times it is accessed.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

- **Add Products:** Allows the user to input a product name and price from the console and add it to the cart.
- **View Cart:** Displays all items currently contained in the cart, along with their price.
- **Exit:** Terminates the application gracefully.

### Design Pattern: Singleton (Creational)

The `ShoppingCart` class implements the Singleton pattern, ensuring a globally accessible, single instance of the cart is used everywhere in the application.

### Class Responsibilities

- **`Main.java`**: Handles all user interaction via the console menu and drives the application flow.
- **`ShoppingCart.java`**: The **Singleton** class. It holds the collection of items and provides methods (`addItem`, `viewCart`) to manage them.
- **`Product.java`**: A simple model that represents a product entity, containing a `name` and a `price`.
