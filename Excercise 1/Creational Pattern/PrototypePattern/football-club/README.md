# Football Club Application

## Overview

A console-based Java application that demonstrates the Prototype Design Pattern.
It allows cloning football player prototypes (Striker, Goalkeeper), customizing them (name, jersey number), and displaying their details.

## Features

Prototypes: Default Striker and Goalkeeper stored in a PlayerRegistry.

Clone Players: Users can choose a prototype and create a new player by cloning.

Customization: Each cloned player can have a new name and jersey number.

Player Info: Displays the player’s details after creation.

## Code Quality

**Encapsulation**: Clear roles between prototype interface, player class, registry, and main client.

**Design Pattern**: Correct Prototype Pattern with cloning implemented.

**Scalability**: New roles (Defender, Midfielder, etc.) can be added easily.
