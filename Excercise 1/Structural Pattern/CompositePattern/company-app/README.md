# 🏢 Company Composite Application
## 📋 Overview

A console-based Java application that demonstrates the Composite Design Pattern.
It models a company hierarchy where departments, team leads, and programmers form a tree-like structure, making it easy to treat individual employees and groups of employees uniformly.

## 🚀 Features

**Hierarchical Structure**: Models departments, team leads, and programmers.

**Composite Pattern**: Departments and team leads can contain other staff.

**Uniform Treatment**: Both single employees (leaf nodes) and groups (composites) can be processed using the same interface.

**Company Display**: Prints a structured view of the company hierarchy.
