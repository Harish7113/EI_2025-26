# 🎄 Christmas Tree Decorator Application

## 📋 Overview

A simple, console-based Java application that demonstrates the Decorator Design Pattern using a Christmas tree example.
Users can decorate a tree with Garland, Lights, and Star dynamically at runtime.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

Start with a plain Christmas tree.

Add multiple decorations (Garland, Lights, Star) based on user input.

Display the final decorated tree.

### Design Pattern

Decorator Pattern:

Allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically without altering its structure.

Each decoration (Garland, Lights, Star) wraps the tree and adds new functionality.
